This is a simple command line app for four different metric conversions, feet to meters, inches to centimeters, miles to kilometers, and millimeters to inches.
It provides the instructions when you initialize the program, all you have to do is enter the number corresponding to the conversion you want to preform and 
enter the value you want. There is input validation, the first input only takes numbers 1-5 and the value input only takes numbers, other wise it will prompt
the user to reinput their value.
